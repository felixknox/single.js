ReadySetSingleApplication
=========================

A ultra simple framework for single page applications - inspired by the work of Josef KjÃ¦rgaard and his amazing Flash framework.

the JSON relies on this structure.

    {
    	sitetree
    	{
    		...
    	},
    	pages
    	{
    		...
    	}
    }

Where sitetree contains the structure of the actual site.

pages contains the page data.

sitetree:
Mandatory
path (path name of the element, ex. work)

Optional
id (used for uniquly seperating the elements - will get created if not defined)
dataId (reference to an element in pages - if not defined a page change event will get called, but no page manipulation will get handled. Great for slideshow deeplinking, where parent page is the slideshow)
title (will fall back to the default title)
nested (defines if a page is nested)
overlay (defines if a page is nested)
OBS. if an element is both defined as nested and overlay, an error will be thrown. 



pages:
Mandatory
dataId (reference id to an element in sitetree)
page (reference to a page type - page is optimized for a namespace structure ex. GalleryExample.pages.GalleryImage)

Optional
Add fields that your page requires.

RSSA.init -->
Option: element
enabledDebug: true
title: "Title when node has no Title"
enableTracking: true

# Todo:
* add pages dynamicly via JS, and not just via JSON.
* make some good practice examples.
* a pageless implementation (check if pages in the JSON is present)


# Features:
* title, include title in the JSON
* Classes with a namespace structure.
* Overlay page, ignores the current page and just displays a page "on top".
* Nested pages, fires the page underneath, and opens that page. Opens nested page after parent page is opened (it's dependent on it's parent).
* is sibling of
* next/forward (history)

# Auto features:
* automatically inits rootNode if no deeplink is choosen.
