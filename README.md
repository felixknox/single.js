ReadySetSingleApplication
=========================

A ultra simple framework for single page applications - inspired by the work of Josef Kj√¶rgaard and his incredible Flash framework.

Far from done - aiming for the 10th. of September 2012.


# Todo:
* add pages dynamicly via JS, and not just via JSON.
* make some good practice examples.
* set title, if title is present from JSON. else fallback to initOptions title.
* nested pages / overlay pages
* a pageless implementation (check if pages in the JSON is present)
